### 1000 WATT WIND TURBINE

[http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-1000-watt-wind-turbine/](http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-1000-watt-wind-turbine/ "http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-1000-watt-wind-turbine/")

> We built a 1000 watt wind turbine to help charge the battery bank that powers our offgrid home. It's a permanent magnet alternator, generating 3 phase ac, rectified to dc, and fed to a charge controller. The magnets spin with the wind, the coils are fixed, so no brushes or slip rings necessary.
