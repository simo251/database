## ASIMPAC

> ASIMPAC is a society transition proposal stemming from a corporative community to tackle the global challenges that the present system is unfit to address

## Kadagaya

[http://www.kadagaya.org/index.php/en/](http://www.kadagaya.org/index.php/en/)

> Kadagaya is a community focusing on the implementation of a resource-based economy (RBE). Our first pilot project is based in Junin, Peru, where we are constructing an experimental village to evaluate the concepts of RBE. We are aiming to achieve self-sufficiency, reduce human labour and increase quality of life through the development of advanced (mostly open-source) technologies and increasing the consciousness of the community. The supporting systems (e.g. energy, water, agriculture, health, and education) are being holistically designed to increase efficiency and reliability while promoting the consciousness of the interdependency of all systems. Accessibility of knowledge is fundamental to the development of an RBE society and hence all developments from Kadagaya will be freely available to anyone who is interested.

## Decentralized Society Research Project

> I am Mathijs de Bruin from The Netherlands. Having been frustrated for a long time about living as part of ‘the system’ (the economic and social structures that dominate our lives) I decided to exchange my house in Amsterdam for a more sustainable and humane form of life. 
>
> Within several (3-4) years my plan is to either join or found a sustainable community, being largely independent of dominating power structures forcing the exploitation of our planet and one another. 

## Freelife project

> Architectural open-source project of modular, autonomous (passive) houses based on rapid prototyping with aeroponic system called Freelife.

## Koto coop

[http://kotocoop.org](http://kotocoop.org)

> We will start an co-op that will fund and set up “units” where members can live ecologically without barter, improve their skills and plans which help expand the way of living and gather resources needed to set up a next unit. Number of units will grow exponentially and money needed for the next unit decrease because resources will be produced more and more inside co-op.
>
> Participation share will grant you right to live in any of the units and move to another unit at will. Price of the share is so equals to price of the resources needed to build one apartment. Monthly cost will be less than what people typically pay rent.

## Ubuntu Planet - One Small Town

[http://www.onesmalltown.org/]()

> Hello this is Michael Tellinger, I am the founder of the UBUNTU Liberation Movement.
>
> It gives me great joy, on behalf of the UBUNTU USA team, to launch our new strategy and our simple plan of action, which we call ONE SMALL TOWN, can change the world.
>
> Our objective is to turn one small town in the USA into a model for other towns, the kind of place that most of us have dreamed of all our lives, and to lay the foundation for a new social structure and a world free from economic slavery.
>
> A place of abundance and prosperity– where anything we imagine is possible.

## Open Source Ecology (OSE)

[https://www.opensourceecology.org/](https://www.opensourceecology.org/)

> An open source, libre economy is an efficient economy which increases innovation by open collaboration. To get there, OSE is currently developing a set of open source blueprints for the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS) – a set of the 50 most important machines that it takes for modern life to exist – everything from a tractor, to an oven, to a circuit maker. In the process of creating the GVCS, OSE intends to develop a modular, scalable platform for documenting and developing open source, libre hardware – including blueprints for both physical artifacts and for related open enterprises.

## One Community

[https://www.onecommunityglobal.org/overview/](https://www.onecommunityglobal.org/overview/)

> One Community is a 100% volunteer-operated non-profit and non-governmental organization creating open source resources and solutions for all aspects of sustainable and globally-regenerative living.

## Envienta - Open source everything

[https://envienta.com/](https://envienta.com/)

> ENVIENTA is an open source hardware-developing platform helping innovators, creators and 
makerspaces to connect with supporters and consumers in a decentralized cloud-manufacturing 
framework. At early stage the project mainly focuses on solutions for sustainable living, home 
automation, green-energy and food production.
