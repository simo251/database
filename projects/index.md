## ASIMPAC

> ASIMPAC is a society transition proposal stemming from a corporative community to tackle the global challenges that the present system is unfit to address

## Kadagaya

[http://www.kadagaya.org/index.php/en/](http://www.kadagaya.org/index.php/en/)

> Kadagaya is a community focusing on the implementation of a resource-based economy (RBE). Our first pilot project is based in Junin, Peru, where we are constructing an experimental village to evaluate the concepts of RBE. We are aiming to achieve self-sufficiency, reduce human labour and increase quality of life through the development of advanced (mostly open-source) technologies and increasing the consciousness of the community. The supporting systems (e.g. energy, water, agriculture, health, and education) are being holistically designed to increase efficiency and reliability while promoting the consciousness of the interdependency of all systems. Accessibility of knowledge is fundamental to the development of an RBE society and hence all developments from Kadagaya will be freely available to anyone who is interested.

## Koto coop

[http://kotocoop.org](http://kotocoop.org)

> We will start an co-op that will fund and set up “units” where members can live ecologically without barter, improve their skills and plans which help expand the way of living and gather resources needed to set up a next unit. Number of units will grow exponentially and money needed for the next unit decrease because resources will be produced more and more inside co-op.
>
> Participation share will grant you right to live in any of the units and move to another unit at will. Price of the share is so equals to price of the resources needed to build one apartment. Monthly cost will be less than what people typically pay rent.

## Ubuntu Planet - One Small Town

[http://www.onesmalltown.org/]()

> Hello this is Michael Tellinger, I am the founder of the UBUNTU Liberation Movement.
>
> It gives me great joy, on behalf of the UBUNTU USA team, to launch our new strategy and our simple plan of action, which we call ONE SMALL TOWN, can change the world.
>
> Our objective is to turn one small town in the USA into a model for other towns, the kind of place that most of us have dreamed of all our lives, and to lay the foundation for a new social structure and a world free from economic slavery.
>
> A place of abundance and prosperity– where anything we imagine is possible.

## RBE 10k project

[http://en.rbem.org/wiki/RBE10K](http://en.rbem.org/wiki/RBE10K)

> RBE10K is a minimalist (simple living) or eco-communalist experiment project seeking to implement the a basic Resource-Based Economic Model (RBEM) system. The experiment is being planned and prepared through this Wiki, and will involve 10,000 volunteers in a yet to-be-determined location, with a main objective of trialling a real world RBEM, i.e. a social arrangement engineered to satisfy premises of sustainability, equality, liberty, health, and access to the necessities of life without using money, trade, or authority or privilege systems.
